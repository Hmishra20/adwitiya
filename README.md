🚀 Adwitiya – AI Powered Smart Safety Platform

Adwitiya is a predictive safety intelligence platform designed to enhance urban mobility security for women and students.
It transforms safety from reactive response to proactive risk awareness using real-time route analysis and emergency alert systems.

🎯 Problem Statement

Urban commuters often select routes without understanding potential safety risks such as isolation zones, low-surveillance areas, and delayed emergency response.

Most existing solutions are reactive — they respond after incidents occur.

Adwitiya introduces predictive intelligence before and during travel.
